In this work, we have described our interface code permitting Perple\_X to be integrated into other C++ programs, and we have demonstrated the code through implementing both particle property and material model plugins within ASPECT.
Some example scenarios have been investigated and the code's performance has been measured to determine its viability for increasing levels of computational complexity and parallelism.

We have identified that the particle property plugin scales excellently with increasing parallelism and runs comparatively quickly with simple but powerful options for controlling performance.
In contrast, the material model plugin, whilst permitting a study of two-phase flow, suffers from dramatic amounts of overhead and scales poorly with increasing parallelism.

Finally, several suggestions have been made to improve the code both in performance and accuracy and some useful extension work has been explained.
