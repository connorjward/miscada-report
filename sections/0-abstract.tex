The processes of melt generation and migration are important in the study of geodynamics in areas near the Earth's surface and are one of the main reasons why the planet has such a diverse geology.
In fact, without melting, it is likely that the Earth would just have a single, uniform rock type instead of the continental and oceanic lithospheres that we have today.
Typically geodynamical codes modelling the melting process assume parametrised melting models that depend on the pressure and temperature, and do not take into account the fact that the melting process is highly dependent on the chemical composition of the solid rock.
In this work we introduce a new software tool combining the geodynamical code ASPECT with the thermodynamical code Perple\_X thereby allowing for a composition-aware analysis of the melting process.
We evaluate the functionality and performance of this code using several model setups and provide some recommendations for future improvements to the software.
The code is open-source and freely available to view and edit.
