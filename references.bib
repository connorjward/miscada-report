Our previous paper focused on the computation of physical properties. In this paper, our focus shifts to the phase equilibria. We further develop our theory to specify the ideal and excess contributions to solution properties and derive properties of multiphase assemblages. We discuss our global inversion strategy for determining the values of the free parameters in our theory and compare inverted parameter values with expectations based on scaling arguments. Comparisons between our method and experimental phase equilibria data encompass the pressure–temperature regime of Earth’s mantle. Finally, we present applications of our method that illustrate how it may be used to explore the origins of mantle structure and mantle dynamics. Continuing rapid advances in experimental and theoretical petrology and mineral physics have motivated an expansion of the scope of our model via the addition of several new phases, and of the soda component: an appendix lists all parameters in our model and references to the experimental and theoretical studies that constrain them. Our algorithm for global minimization of the Gibbs free energy is embodied in a code called {HeFESTo}, and is detailed in a second appendix.},

We use a numerical tool that combines thermo-mechanical models with a thermodynamic database to examine slab dehydration for present-day and early Earth settings and its consequences for the deep water recycling. We investigate the reactions responsible for releasing water from the crust and the hydrated lithospheric mantle and how they change with subduction velocity (vs), slab age (a) and mantle temperature (Tm). Our results show that faster slabs dehydrate over a wide area: they start dehydrating shallower and they carry water deeper into the mantle. We parameterize the amount of water that can be carried deep into the mantle, W (3105 kg/m2), as a function of vs (cm/yr), a (Myrs), and Tm ( C): W51:06vs10:14a20:023Tm117. We generally observe that a 1) 100 C increase in the mantle temperature, or 2) \$15 Myr decrease of plate age, or 3) decrease in subduction velocity of \$2 cm/yr all have the same effect on the amount of water retained in the slab at depth, corresponding to a decrease of \$2.23105 kg/m2 of H2O. We estimate that for present-day conditions \$26\% of the global inﬂux water, or 73108 Tg/Myr of H2O, is recycled into the mantle. Using a realistic distribution of subduction parameters, we illustrate that deep water recycling might still be possible in early Earth conditions, although its efﬁciency would generally decrease. Indeed, 0.5–3.7 3 108 Tg/Myr of H2O could still be recycled in the mantle at 2.8 Ga.},

	abstract = {Many unresolved questions in geodynamics revolve around the physical behaviour of the two-phase system of a silicate melt percolating through and interacting with a tectonically deforming host rock. Well-accepted equations exist to describe the physics of such systems and several previous studies have successfully implemented various forms of these equations in numerical models. To date, most such models of magma dynamics have focused on mantle ﬂow problems and therefore employed viscous creep rheologies suitable to describe the deformation properties of mantle rock under high temperatures and pressures. However, the use of such rheologies is not appropriate to model melt extraction above the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary, where the mode of deformation of the host rock transitions from ductile viscous to brittle elasto-plastic. Here, we introduce a novel approach to numerically model magma dynamics, focusing on the conceptual study of melt extraction from an asthenospheric source of partial melt through the overlying lithosphere and crust. To this end, we introduce an adapted set of two-phase ﬂow equations, coupled to a visco-elasto-plastic rheology for both shear and compaction deformation of the host rock in interaction with the melt phase. We describe in detail how to implement this physical model into a ﬁnite-element code, and then proceed to evaluate the functionality and potential of this methodology using a series of conceptual model setups, which demonstrate the modes of melt extraction occurring around the rheological transition from ductile to brittle host rocks. The models suggest that three principal regimes of melt extraction emerge: viscous diapirism, viscoplastic decompaction channels and elasto-plastic dyking. Thus, our model of magma dynamics interacting with active tectonics of the lithosphere and crust provides a novel framework to further investigate magmato-tectonic processes such as the formation and geometry of magma chambers and conduits, as well as the emplacement of plutonic rock complexes.},

Here we present a novel conceptual model for the formation of granite-migmatite belts: we propose that convective thinning of the lithosphere results in minor amounts of partial melts within the lowermost crust that trigger further instabilities. This will lead to positive feedback eﬀects between melt weakening, mantle upwelling, and wholesale mantle lithosphere removal, causing a strong pulse of mantle and crustal melting. We test this model numerically, and results show that this process, taking between 20 and 50 Myr in total, can explain the temporal evolution of melting in granite-migmatite zones and associated mantle-derived maﬁc rocks and provides a heat source for crustal melting without the need for other processes, such as slab break-oﬀ or increased radiogenic heating. Furthermore, the generation of a refractory residue after mantle and crustal melting is also shown to control the progress of the lithospheric mantle removal, providing another feedback mechanism between melting and lithospheric reequilibration.},

The numerical methods that underlie these simulations have greatly evolved within this time span, and today include dynamically changing and adaptively reﬁned meshes, sophisticated and efﬁcient solvers, and parallelization to large clusters of computers. At the same time, many of the methods – discussed in detail in a previous paper in this series – were developed and tested primarily using model problems that lack many of the complexities that are common to the realistic models our community wants to solve today. With several years of experience solving complex and realistic models, we here revisit some of the algorithm designs of the earlier paper and discuss the incorporation of more complex physics. In particular, we re-consider time stepping and mesh reﬁnement algorithms, evaluate approaches to incorporate compressibility, and discuss dealing with strongly varying material coefﬁcients, latent heat, and how to track chemical compositions and heterogeneities. Taken together and implemented in a high-performance, massively parallel code, the techniques discussed in this paper then allow for high resolution, 3-D, compressible, global mantle convection simulations with phase transitions, strongly temperature dependent viscosity and realistic material properties based on mineral physics data.},

In this paper we will give a detailed description of this code. The temperature equation is advanced in time with the Lagrangian marker techniques based on the method of characteristics and the temperature solution is interpolated back to an Eulerian grid conﬁguration at each timestep. This marker approach allows for the accurate portrayal of very ﬁne thermal structures. For attaining a high relative accuracy in the solution of the matrix equations associated with both the momentum and temperature equations, we have employed the direct matrix inversion technique, which becomes feasible with the advent of very large shared-memory machines. Our conservative ﬁnite-difference schemes allow us to capture sharp variations of the stresses and thermal gradients in problems with a strongly variable viscosity and thermal conductivity. We have tested this code with numerous examples drawn from Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities, the descent of a stiff object into a medium with a lower viscosity, viscous heating and ﬂows with non-Netwonian rheology. We have also benchmarked successfully with variable viscosity convection for lateral viscosity contrast up to 108. We have delineated the regions in thermal problems where the diffusive nature of the temperature equation changes from its parabolic character locally to a non-linear hyperbolic-like equation due to the presence of variable thermal conductivity. Finally we discuss the applicability of this marker-based and ﬁnite-difference technique to other evolutionary equations in geophysics.},

However, they are historically either implemented in sequential codes or in parallel codes with structured, statically partitioned meshes. Yet today’s codes increasingly use adaptive mesh reﬁnement ({AMR}) of unstructured coarse meshes, dynamic repartitioning, and scale to thousands of processors. Optimally balancing the work per processor for a {PIC} method in these environments is a diﬃcult problem, and many existing implementations are not suﬃcient for this task. Thus, there is a need to revisit these algorithms for future applications. Here we describe challenges and solutions to implement {PIC} methods in the context of large-scale parallel geodynamic modeling codes that use dynamically changing meshes. We also provide guidance for how to address bottlenecks that impede the eﬃcient implementation of these algorithms and demonstrate with numerical tests that our algorithms can be implemented with optimal complexity and that they are suitable for large-scale, practical applications.

Additionally, the South Atlantic formed close to where plume volcanism began, opening from the south and progressing northward with a notable decrease in magmatism across the Florianopolis Fracture Zone. We study the full evolution of the Tristan plume in a series of three-dimensional regional models created with the convection code {ASPECT}. We then compute crustal thickness maps and compare them to seismic proﬁles and the topography of the South Atlantic. We ﬁnd that the separation of volcanism into the Tristan and Gough chain can be explained by the position of the plume relative to the ridge and the inﬂuence of the global ﬂow ﬁeld. Plume material below the off-ridge track can ﬂow toward the ridge and regions of thinner lithosphere, where decompression melting leads to the development of a second volcanic chain resembling the Tristan and Gough hotspot tracks. Agreement with the observations is best for a small plume buoyancy ﬂux of 500 kg/s or a low excess temperature of 150 K. The model explains the distribution of syn-rift magmatism by hot plume material that ﬂows into the rift and increases melt generation.},

	abstract = {Mantle convection and long-term lithosphere dynamics in the Earth and other planets can be treated as the slow deformation of a highly viscous ﬂuid, and as such can be described using the compressible Navier–Stokes equations. Since on Earth-sized planets the inﬂuence of compressibility is not a dominant effect, density deviations from a reference proﬁle are at most on the order of a few percent and using the full governing equations poses numerical challenges, most modelling studies have simpliﬁed the governing equations. Common approximations assume a temporally constant, but depth-dependent reference proﬁle for the density (the anelastic liquid approximation), or drop compressibility altogether and use a constant reference density (the Boussinesq approximation). In most previous studies of mantle convection and crustal dynamics, one can assume that the error introduced by these approximations was small compared to the errors that resulted from poorly constrained material behaviour and limited numerical accuracy. However, as model parametrizations have become more realistic, and model resolution has improved, this may no longer be the case and the error due to using simpliﬁed conservation equations might no longer be negligible: while such approximations may be reasonable for models of mantle plumes or slabs traversing the whole mantle, they may be unsatisfactory for layered materials experiencing phase transitions or materials undergoing signiﬁcant heating or cooling. For example, at boundary layers or close to dynamically changing density gradients, the error arising from the use of the aforementioned compressibility approximations can be the dominant error source, and common approximations may fail to capture the physical behaviour of interest. In this paper, we discuss new formulations of the continuity equation that include dynamic density variations due to temperature, pressure and composition without using a reference proﬁle for the density. We quantify the improvement in accuracy relative to existing formulations in a number of benchmark models and evaluate for which practical applications these effects are important. Finally, we consider numerical aspects of the new formulations. We implement and test these formulations in the freely available community software {ASPECT}, and use this code for our numerical experiments.},

We investigate the effect of these two factors using numerical modelling. To simulate oblique inheritance in continental lithosphere, we model an initial rift-transform-rift conﬁguration oriented at a range of angles (−45o to +45o) with respect to the extension direction. In a second suite of calculations, we ﬁrst extend a rift-transform-rift system orthogonally and then vary the extension direction to simulate rotation of the far-ﬁeld stress directions, and hence the relative plate motion. We found that transpressional deformation on the transform results in increased duration of fault activity and diffuse, longer transform zones at higher angles, while the opposite is true for the transtensional case. These observations are in good agreement with natural examples such as the Ungava Transform Zone, the Gulf of California and the Gulf of Aden, indicating that relative plate rotation plays an important role in the structural evolution of transform margins. Finally, we present a metric that links current transform margin morphology to past evolution.},

	abstract = {Melt generation and migration are an important link between surface processes and the thermal and chemical evolution of the Earth’s interior. However, their vastly different timescales make it difﬁcult to study mantle convection and melt migration in a uniﬁed framework, especially for 3-D global models. And although experiments suggest an increase in melt volume of up to 20 per cent from the depth of melt generation to the surface, previous computations have neglected the individual compressibilities of the solid and the ﬂuid phase. Here, we describe our extension of the ﬁnite element mantle convection code {ASPECT} that adds melt generation and migration. We use the original compressible formulation of the {McKenzie} equations, augmented by an equation for the conservation of energy. Applying adaptive mesh reﬁnement to this type of problems is particularly advantageous, as the resolution can be increased in areas where melt is present and viscosity gradients are high, whereas a lower resolution is sufﬁcient in regions without melt. Together with a high-performance, massively parallel implementation, this allows for high-resolution, 3-D, compressible, global mantle convection simulations coupled with melt migration. We evaluate the functionality and potential of this method using a series of benchmarks and model setups, compare results of the compressible and incompressible formulation, and show the effectiveness of adaptive mesh reﬁnement when applied to melt migration. Our model of magma dynamics provides a framework for modelling processes on different scales and investigating links between processes occurring in the deep mantle and melt generation and migration. This approach could prove particularly useful applied to modelling the generation of komatiites or other melts originating in greater depths. The implementation is available in the Open Source {ASPECT} repository.},

The user can deﬁne the composition from a list of minerals provided for the lower mantle or easily include their own. {BurnMan} provides choices in methodology, both for the {EoS} and for the multiphase averaging scheme. The results can be visually or quantitatively compared to observed seismic models. Example user scripts show how to go through these steps. This paper includes several examples realized with {BurnMan}: First, we benchmark the computations to check for correctness. Second, we exemplify two pitfalls in {EoS} modeling: using a different {EoS} than the one used to derive the mineral physical parameters or using an incorrect averaging scheme. Both pitfalls have led to incorrect conclusions on lower mantle composition and temperature in the literature. We further illustrate that ﬁtting elastic velocities separately or jointly leads to different Mg/Si ratios for the lower mantle. However, we ﬁnd that, within mineral physical uncertainties, a pyrolitic composition can match {PREM} very well. Finally, we ﬁnd that uncertainties on speciﬁc input parameters result in a considerable amount of variation in both magnitude and gradient of the seismic velocities.},

We apply this tool to quantify how the hydration state of a lithologically layered subducting slab varies during interaction with the hot mantle wedge and how this affects any melting taking place in the subducting crust or the overlying mantle wedge. Total crustal dehydration is achieved before any crustal melting can occur, even in very young subducting slabs. Signiﬁcant oceanic crust melting is only achieved if the metamorphic ﬂuids from the dehydrating underlying subducting slab mantle are ﬂuxed through the dry eclogites. But our models further demonstrate that even if the oceanic crust can melt in these speciﬁc conditions, the preceding crustal dehydration will simultaneously result in extensive mantle wedge melting at lower pressures than for colder slabs. The signiﬁcant mantle wedge melting implies that also for hot subduction zones, most of the melt feeding the overriding plate is of mantle origin.},

In contrast, young, weak oceanic slabs show the ﬁrst break-off already 10 Myr after continental collision, and can experience tear migration rates up to 800 mm/yr.

An improved order–disorder model for spinel is now incorporated. Above 10 kbar pressure, wet partial melting relations may be signiﬁcantly affected by the dissolution of silicates in aqueous ﬂuid, so the set of models includes an aqueous low-density silicatebearing ﬂuid in addition to a high-density H2O-bearing silicate melt.

	abstract = {Grain size plays a key role in controlling the mechanical properties of the Earth’s mantle, affecting both long-time-scale ﬂow patterns and anelasticity on the time scales of seismic wave propagation. However, dynamic models of Earth’s convecting mantle usually implement ﬂow laws with constant grain size, stress-independent viscosity, and a limited treatment of changes in mineral assemblage. We study grain size evolution, its interplay with stress and strain rate in the convecting mantle, and its inﬂuence on seismic velocities and attenuation. Our geodynamic models include the simultaneous and competing effects of dynamic recrystallization resulting from dislocation creep, grain growth in multiphase assemblages, and recrystallization at phase transitions. They show that grain size evolution drastically affects the dynamics of mantle convection and the rheology of the mantle, leading to lateral viscosity variations of 6 orders of magnitude due to grain size alone, and controlling the shape of upwellings and downwellings. Using laboratory-derived scaling relationships, we convert model output to seismologically observable parameters (velocity and attenuation) facilitating comparison to Earth structure. Reproducing the fundamental features of the Earth’s attenuation proﬁle requires reduced activation volume and relaxed shear moduli in the lower mantle compared to the upper mantle, in agreement with geodynamic constraints. Faster lower mantle grain growth yields best ﬁt to seismic observations, consistent with our reexamination of high-pressure grain growth parameters. We also show that ignoring grain size in interpretations of seismic anomalies may underestimate the Earth’s true temperature variations.},

	abstract = {An algorithm for the construction of phase diagram sections is formulated that is well suited for geodynamic problems in which it is necessary to assess the influence of phase transitions on rock properties or the evolution and migration of fluids. The basis of the algorithm is the representation of the continuous compositional variations of solution phases by series of discrete compositions. As a consequence of this approximation the classical non-linear free energy minimization problem is trivially solved by linear programming. Phase relations are then mapped as a function of the variables of interest using bisection to locate phase boundaries. Treatment of isentropic and isothermal phase relations involving felsic and mafic silicate melts by this method is illustrated. To demonstrate the tractability of more complex problems involving mass transfer, a model for infiltration driven-decarbonation in subduction zones is evaluated. As concluded from earlier closed system models, the open-system model indicates that carbonates are likely to persist in the subducted oceanic crust beyond sub-arc depths even if the upper section of the oceanic mantle is extensively hydrated. However, in contrast to more simplistic models of slab devolatilization, the open-system model suggests slab fluid production is heterogeneous and ephemeral. Computed seismic velocity profiles, together with thermodynamic constraints, imply that for typical geothermal conditions serpentinization of the subducted mantle is unlikely to extend to N 25 km depth and that the average water-content of the serpentinized mantle is b 2 wt.\%.

While simulations of star clusters have become more realistic, and now include the evolution of single and binary stars, the prospect of reaching large enough N is still a distant one. Nevertheless more restricted kinds of simulations have recently brought valuable progress for certain problems of current observational interest, including the origin and structure of tidal tails of globular clusters. In addition, such simulations have forced us to rethink some basic aspects of stellar dynamics, including, in particular, the process of escape. Finally we turn to faster, approximate methods for studying star cluster dynamics, where the role of N -body simulations is one of calibration.},

	abstract = {We explore the risk that self-reinforcing feedbacks could push the Earth System toward a planetary threshold that, if crossed, could prevent stabilization of the climate at intermediate temperature rises and cause continued warming on a “Hothouse Earth” pathway even as human emissions are reduced. Crossing the threshold would lead to a much higher global average temperature than any interglacial in the past 1.2 million years and to sea levels significantly higher than at any time in the Holocene. We examine the evidence that such a threshold might exist and where it might be. If the threshold is crossed, the resulting trajectory would likely cause serious disruptions to ecosystems, society, and economies. Collective human action is required to steer the Earth System away from a potential threshold and stabilize it in a habitable interglacial-like state. Such action entails stewardship of the entire Earth System—biosphere, climate, and societies—and could include decarbonization of the global economy, enhancement of biosphere carbon sinks, behavioral changes, technological innovations, new governance arrangements, and transformed social values.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02017},
	abstract = {A tight lower bound for required I/O when computing an ordinary matrix-matrix multiplication on a processor with two layers of memory is established. Prior work obtained weaker lower bounds by reasoning about the number of segments needed to perform \$C:={AB}\$, for distinct matrices \$A\$, \$B\$, and \$C\$, where each segment is a series of operations involving \$M\$ reads and writes to and from fast memory, and \$M\$ is the size of fast memory. A lower bound on the number of segments was then determined by obtaining an upper bound on the number of elementary multiplications performed per segment. This paper follows the same high level approach, but improves the lower bound by (1) transforming algorithms for {MMM} so that they perform all computation via fused multiply-add instructions ({FMAs}) and using this to reason about only the cost associated with reading the matrices, and (2) decoupling the per-segment I/O cost from the size of fast memory. For \$n {\textbackslash}times n\$ matrices, the lower bound's leading-order term is \$2n{\textasciicircum}3/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{M\}\$. A theoretical algorithm whose leading terms attains this is introduced. To what extent the state-of-the-art Goto's Algorithm attains the lower bound is discussed.},

	abstract = {Gibbs energy minimization is the means by which the stable state of a system can be computed as a function of pressure, temperature and chemical composition from thermodynamic data. In this context, state implies knowledge of the identity, amount, and composition of the various phases of matter in heterogeneous systems. For seismic phenomena, which occur on time-scales that are short compared to the timescales of intra-phase equilibration, the Gibbs energy functions of the individual phases are equations of state that can be used to recover seismic wave speeds. Thermodynamic properties relevant to modelling of slower geodynamic processes are recovered by numeric differentiation of the Gibbs energy function of the system obtained by minimization. Gibbs energy minimization algorithms are categorized by whether they solve the non-linear optimization problem directly or solve a linearized formulation. The former express the objective function, the total Gibbs energy of the system, indirectly in terms of the partial molar Gibbs energies of phase species rather than directly in terms of the Gibbs energies of the possible phases. The indirect formulation of the objective function has the consequence that although these algorithms are capable of attaining high precision they have no generic means of treating phase separation and expertise is required to avoid local minima. In contrast, the solution of the fully linearized problem is completely robust, but offers limited resolution. Algorithms that iteratively refine linearized solutions offer a compromise between robustness and precision that is well suited to the demands of geophysical modeling.},

Firedrake adopts the domain-specific language for the finite element method of the {FEniCS} project, but with a pure Python runtime-only implementation centred on the composition of several existing and new abstractions for particular aspects of scientific computing. The result is a more complete separation of concerns which eases the incorporation of separate contributions from computer scientists, numerical analysts and application specialists. These contributions may add functionality, or improve performance. Firedrake benefits from automatically applying new optimisations. This includes factorising mixed function spaces, transforming and vectorising inner loops, and intrinsically supporting block matrix operations. Importantly, Firedrake presents a simple public {API} for escaping the {UFL} abstraction. This allows users to implement common operations that fall outside pure variational formulations, such as flux-limiters.},

	abstract = {The historic Paris Agreement calls for limiting global temperature rise to “well below 2 °C.” Because of uncertainties in emission scenarios, climate, and carbon cycle feedback, we interpret the Paris Agreement in terms of three climate risk categories and bring in considerations of low-probability (5\%) high-impact ({LPHI}) warming in addition to the central (∼50\% probability) value. The current risk category of dangerous warming is extended to more categories, which are defined by us here as follows: {\textgreater}1.5 °C as dangerous; {\textgreater}3 °C as catastrophic; and {\textgreater}5 °C as unknown, implying beyond catastrophic, including existential threats. With unchecked emissions, the central warming can reach the dangerous level within three decades, with the {LPHI} warming becoming catastrophic by 2050. We outline a three-lever strategy to limit the central warming below the dangerous level and the {LPHI} below the catastrophic level, both in the near term ({\textless}2050) and in the long term (2100): the carbon neutral ({CN}) lever to achieve zero net emissions of {CO}

              blanket. Pulling on both {CN} and {SP} levers and bending the emissions curve by 2020 can keep the central warming below dangerous levels. To limit the {LPHI} warming below dangerous levels, the {CES} lever must be pulled as well to extract as much as 1 trillion tons of {CO}

This family of mixed ﬁnite element methods can be thought of in the numerical weather prediction context as a generalisation of the popular polygonal C-grid ﬁnite diﬀerence methods. There are a few major advantages: the mixed ﬁnite element methods do not require an orthogonal grid, and they allow a degree of ﬂexibility that can be exploited to ensure an appropriate ratio between the velocity and pressure degrees of freedom so as to avoid spurious mode branches in the numerical dispersion relation. These methods preserve several properties of the C-grid method when applied to linear barotropic wave propagation, namely: a) energy conservation, b) mass conservation, c) no spurious pressure modes, and d) steady geostrophic modes on the f -plane. We explain how these properties are preserved, and describe two examples that can be used on pseudo-uniform grids: the recently-developed modiﬁed {RTk}-Q(k-1) element pairs on quadrilaterals and the {BDFM}1-P 1DG element pair on triangles. All of these mixed ﬁnite element methods have an exact 2:1 ratio of velocity degrees of freedom to pressure degrees of freedom. Finally we illustrate the properties with some numerical examples.},

In addition to distilling best practices from existing work, we propose statistically sound analysis and reporting techniques and simple guidelines for experimental design in parallel computing and codify them in a portable benchmarking library. We aim to improve the standards of reporting research results and initiate a discussion in the {HPC} ﬁeld. A wide adoption of our minimal set of rules will lead to better interpretability of performance results and improve the scientiﬁc culture in {HPC}.},

	abstract = {We present the basic idea, implementation, measured performance and performance model of {FDPS} (Framework for developing particle simulators). {FDPS} is an application-development framework which helps the researchers to develop simulation programs using particle methods for large-scale distributed-memory parallel supercomputers. A particle-based simulation program for distributed-memory parallel computers needs to perform domain decomposition, exchange of particles which are not in the domain of each computing node, and gathering of the particle information in other nodes which are necessary for interaction calculation. Also, even if distributed-memory parallel computers are not used, in order to reduce the amount of computation, algorithms such as Barnes-Hut tree algorithm or Fast Multipole Method should be used in the case of long-range interactions. For short-range interactions, some methods to limit the calculation to neighbor particles are necessary. {FDPS} provides all of these functions which are necessary for efﬁcient parallel execution of particle-based simulations as “templates”, which are independent of the actual data structure of particles and the functional form of the particle-particle interaction. By using {FDPS}, researchers can write their programs with the amount of work necessary to write a simple, sequential and unoptimized program of O(N 2) calculation cost, and yet the program, once compiled with {FDPS}, will run efﬁciently on largescale parallel supercomputers. A simple gravitational N -body program can be written in around 120 lines. We report the actual performance of these programs and the performance model. The weak scaling performance is very good, and almost linear speedup was obtained for up to the full system of K computer. The minimum calculation time per timestep is in the range of 30 ms (N = 107) to 300 ms (N = 109). These are currently limited by the time for the calculation of the domain decomposition and communication necessary for the interaction calculation. We discuss how we can overcome these bottlenecks.},

We investigate the ﬁnite element pair applied to the linear shallow-water equations on an f -plane. The element pair has the property that all geostrophically balanced states which strongly satisfy the boundary conditions have discrete divergence equal to exactly zero and hence are exactly steady states of the discretised equations. This means that the ﬁnite element pair has excellent geostrophic balance properties. We also show that the element pair applied to the non-rotating linear shallow-water equations does not have any spurious small eigenvalues. We illustrate these properties using numerical tests and provide convergence calculations which show that the numerical solutions have errors which decay quadratically with element edge length for both velocity and layer thickness.},

These simulations involve the bottom-up assembly of clusters through hierarchical mergers, which produces a fractal stellar distribution at young ({\textasciitilde}0.5 Myr) ages. The resulting clusters are predicted to be mildly aspherical and highly mass-segregated, except in the immediate aftermath of mergers. The upper initial mass function within individual clusters is generally somewhat flatter than for the aggregate population. Recent work has begun to clarify the factors that control the mean stellar mass in a star-forming cloud and also the efficiency of star formation. The former is sensitive to the thermal properties of the gas while the latter depends both on the magnetic field and the initial degree of gravitational boundedness of the natal cloud. Unmagnetized clouds that are initially bound undergo rapid collapse, which is difficult to reverse by ionization feedback or stellar winds.},

	abstract = {We present a theory for the computation of phase equilibria and physical properties of multicomponent assemblages relevant to the mantle of the Earth. The theory differs from previous treatments in being thermodynamically self-consistent: the theory is based on the concept of fundamental thermodynamic relations appropriately generalized to anisotropic strain and in encompassing elasticity in addition to the usual isotropic thermodynamic properties. In this ﬁrst paper, we present the development of the theory, discuss its scope, and focus on its application to physical properties of mantle phases at elevated pressure and temperature including the equation of state, thermochemical properties and the elastic wave velocities. We ﬁnd that the Eulerian ﬁnite strain formulation captures the variation of the elastic moduli with compression. The variation of the vibrational frequencies with compression is also cast as a Taylor series expansion in the Eulerian ﬁnite strain, the appropriate volume derivative of which leads to an expression for the Gru¨neisen parameter that agrees well with results from ﬁrst principles theory. For isotropic materials, the theory contains nine material-speciﬁc parameters: the values at ambient conditions of the Helmholtz free energy, volume, bulk and shear moduli, their pressure derivatives, an effective Debye temperature, its ﬁrst and second logarithmic volume derivatives (γ 0, q 0), and the shear strain derivative of γ . We present and discuss in some detail the results of a global inversion of a wide variety of experimental data and ﬁrst principles theoretical results, supplemented by systematic relations, for the values of these parameters for 31 mantle species. Among our ﬁndings is that the value of q is likely to be signiﬁcantly greater than unity for most mantle species. We apply the theory to the computation of the shear wave velocity, and temperature and compositional (Fe content) derivatives at relevant mantle pressure temperature conditions. Among the patterns that emerge is that garnet is anomalous in being remarkably insensitive to iron content or temperature as compared with other mantle phases.},

	abstract = {We quantify the complex interdependence of stellar binarity, the stellar massluminosity relation, the mass function, the colour-magnitude relation and Galactic disc structure, all of which must be understood when analysing star-count data and stellar luminosity functions. We derive a mass-M, relation and a model for the change of stellar luminosity with changes in chemical abundance and age. Combination of this with detailed modelling of all astrophysical and observational contributions to the Malmquist scatter allows us to model star-count data without approximating Malmquist corrections. We show for the first time that a single mass function and normalization explain the stellar distribution towards both Galactic poles, as well as the distribution of stars within a distance of 5.2 pc of the Sun. The initial mass function can be approximated by {\textasciicircum}(m)« m with a3 {\textasciitilde} 2.7 for stars more massive than 1 M©, a2 a 2.2 in the mass range 0.5{\textasciicircum} 1 M0 and 0.70 {\textless} oq {\textless} 1.85 in the range 0.08 {\textless} m{\textasciicircum}0.5 M0. If the stars at a distance of about 100 pc from the Galactic mid-plane have a metallicity smaller by about 0.1 dex than do the stars near the plane used to calibrate the mass-M {\textasciicircum} and colour-magnitude relations, then both the stars within 5.2 pc of the Sun and the star-count data reaching to a photometric distance of 130 pc lead to a low-mass power-law index of al {\textasciitilde} 1.5. The change in the power index at 0.5 {MG} may indicate a characteristic mass-scale in the star formation process. Our model is most consistent with the data if the proportion of binaries among ‘stars’ is larger than 50 per cent and if the component masses are uncorrelated. The possible decline of the proportion of binaries with increasing absolute magnitude, observed in the solar neighbourhood, is in agreement with our models. Two features in the luminosity function for low-mass stars are universal, being solely the result of stellar physics. These features are a flattening at My{\textasciicircum}l and a conspicuous maximum at Mv{\textasciitilde} 12. Binary stars cause the system luminosity function derived from photographic surveys to decrease uniformly with increasing magnitude relative to the single-star luminosity function, but both show the same general features. The solar neighbourhood mass density in main-sequence stars with masses between 0.08 and 100 M0 is p = 0.05 ± 0.01 M0 pc-3, of which main-sequence stars less massive than the Sun contribute about 80 per cent. These estimates explicitly include the effects of binaries. Unresolved binaries cause the apparent disc scaleheight to decrease with decreasing mass to a value of « 150 pc for star-count data in the colour range 4{\textless} l7-/{\textless}4.5 if all ‘stars’ are unresolved binaries with uncorrelated component masses. The vertical structure of the Galactic disc is not well described by a single exponential within a few hundred pc of the plane. Neglect of this can lead to a spurious apparent correlation between stellar mass and disc scaleheight.},

If the local velocity dispersion of the subcondensations is small, the overall dimension of the system can decrease substantially before reaching a dynamical equilibrium state. We deduce the maximum collapse factor by examining the growth of the velocity dispersion and the spread in arrival times at the origin caused by local and global fluctuations. We show, analytically as well as in a series of {AT}-body simulations, that the maximum reduction in the characteristic dimension of a system of N fragments with an initial homogeneous distribution subject to N1/2 fluctuations is proportional to {iV}1/3. Direct physical collisions between low-mass subcondensations are therefore unlikely to occur in protoglobular clusters. We discuss our results in the context of fragmentation and violent relaxation.},

The equations define a length scale dc called the compaction length, which depends only on the material properties of the melt and matrix. A number of simple solutions to the equations show that, if the porosity is initially constant, matrix compaction only occurs within a distance {\textasciitilde}{\textless}5C of an impermeable boundary. Elsewhere the gravitational forces are supported by the viscous stresses resulting from the movement of melt, and no compaction occurs. The velocity necessary to prevent compaction is known as the minimum fluidization velocity. In all cases the compaction rate is controlled by the.properties of the matrix. These results can only be applied to geological problems if the values of the permeability, bulk and shear viscosity of the matrix can be estimated. All three depend on the microscopic geometry of the melt, which is in turn controlled by the dihedral angle. The likely equilibrium network provides some guidance in estimating the order of magnitude of these constants, but is no substitute for good measurements, which are yet to be carried out. Partial melting by release of pressure at constant entropy is then examined as a means of produced melt within the earth.},

	title = {On Gravothermal Oscillations},
	volume = {313},
	abstract = {Gravothermal oscillations of postcollapse star clusters are investigated by studying an analogous system, a self-gravitating, conducting gas sphere. The gas is assumed to have a distributed energy source depending on local density and temperature. It is shown that certain functional forms for the energy term permit a new type of self-similar postcollapse solution in which both the core radius and the half-mass radius expand as the two-thirds power of time and the total mass is constant. Creation of binaries in three-body processes leads to one such functional form. Self-similar solutions are exhibited for this interesting case. The solutions are nonsingular and approximately isothermal within the half-mass radius. They are parameterized by the total number of stars, {AT}, and become more centrally condensed with increasing N. The linear stability of these solutions is studied. They are stable for N less than -7000, overstable for N between 7000 and 40,000, and unstable for larger N. For very large {iV}, the instability reduces to the familiar gravothermal instability of an infinite isothermal sphere. The amplitude of nonlinear gravothermal oscillations is estimated and found to increase with N. Implications for globular clusters and for {iV}-body simulations are discussed. It is argued that the linear instability and the nonlinear expansion phase are not directly dependent on the nature of the energy source; rather, they depend on the degree of central concentration in the slowly expanding “equilibrium.” At maximum expansion, the core engulfs {\textasciitilde}l\%-2\% of the total mass. This corresponds to King models having concentration parameters -2-3 and suggests that some very concentrated globular clusters are near the maximum expansion of a postcollapse gravothermal oscillation.},

Giant Molecular Clouds ({GMCs}) stretch a globular cluster in a direction transverse to its orbit through the disk. The variation in acceleration with height in the disk compresses the cluster in a longitudinal direction. Numerical and analytic calculations of heating and mass loss for {GCs}, represented by King models, show that disk heating dominates. We apply the results to calculate {GC} evolution prior to core collapse or tidal disruption using a three-parameter (energy, mass, and tidal radius) sequence of King models. The changes in the parameters are calculated for tidal perturbations, relaxation, and evaporation. Clusters close to the Galactic center (less than 3 kpc) undergo core collapse in a Hubble time. The effect of tidal perturbations on energy and mass loss of the cluster is strongest between 3 and 5 kpc where it can substantially effect the evolution of the cluster. Here, depending upon their initial concentration, clusters are either tidally heated and dissolved, or forced toward a gravothermal catastrophe in times that are a fraction of a Hubble time. These inner regions of the Galaxy should be fertile territory for the search for postcollapsed clusters by the Space Telescope.},

The violently changing gravitational field of a newly formed galaxy is effective in changing the statistics of stellar orbits. The equilibrium distribution under this encounterless relaxation is found by use of a fourth type of statistics related to both Fermi-Dirac statistics and equipartition of energy per unit mass. In the relevant limit this becomes Maxwell’s distribution but with temperature proportional to mass.},

Proc. 97-2 (1997) 9.], have been characterized by both {DC} and {AC} magnetic measurements between 5 K and 108 K with a magnetic field perpendicular to the ab plane of the Bi-2223 crystal lattice. A numerical calculation indicates that the induced fields from the superconducting current loops in the separated neighboring crystals are very small and consequently can be neglected. Treating the individual crystals (73×73×1 μm3) as bar-shaped superconductors, we used a modified Bean model to determine the critical current density. For the first time, a strong temperature dependence of the current density at zero applied field is observed in these pristine single crystals with weak pinning. These then offer an excellent model system to probe the enhancements of persistent currents by means of proton irradiation.},
